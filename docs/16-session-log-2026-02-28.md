# Session Log — February 28, 2026

## Decisions Made

### 1. 3-Phase Intake Convergence (Designed, Not Implemented)

Voice and form paths currently diverge — different fields, different orders, different screens. Decided to converge into a unified 3-phase flow:

- **Phase 1 "About You"**: Voice + form as tab toggle on ONE screen. Both collect the same 7 fields: age, sex, height, weight, BP, waist, family history.
- **Phase 2 "Import & Enrich"**: Shared screen for both paths. Labs (PDF/paste/manual), device selector, medication typeahead, PHQ-9 (actual 0-27 score via questionnaire or direct entry, not binary toggle).
- **Phase 3 "Results"**: Unchanged.

Key structural changes:
- Gap bridge eliminated (bridge.js deleted) — Phase 2 replaces it entirely
- 4-step form collapsed to single screen + shared Phase 2
- Voice submit → Phase 2 (not bridge)
- PHQ-9 becomes a real 0-27 scored instrument with standing thresholds

Files affected: index.html, src/form.js, src/intake.js, src/main.js, score.js, css/app.css, new src/phq9.js, delete src/bridge.js.

### 2. Calendar Integration as Reinforcement Loop (New Insight)

The timeline card ("this week / this quarter / one-time") could integrate with Google Calendar. Measurement protocols become calendar events: "BP Day 4 of 7" as a morning reminder, "Lipid panel retest" as a quarterly event. This creates a reinforcement loop that lives where people already look, rather than requiring them to re-open the app.

Connects to: ux-philosophy.md queue model, Habica integration, the nudge system design.

### 3. Distribution Gap Identified

We have 39+ content hooks, drafted threads, a content calendar — but almost nothing has shipped. Only the Paul LinkedIn reply is live. The X thread, Reddit posts, and quote-tweet flywheel are all still in draft. This is the highest-leverage gap: getting signal from real humans matters more than any code change right now.

Content launch sequence should start ~Mar 3 per the existing content calendar.

### 4. Workflow Learning: Document Decisions During Sessions

Context gets lost when conversations compact. Decisions and design work should be written to docs/ during the session, not just discussed in conversation. This session log is an example of that practice.

---

## What We Built Today

- Designed the full 3-phase intake plan with file-by-file changes specified
- Deep review of all documentation (altitude framework, product flow, UX philosophy, distribution strategy, content hooks, Habica integration, platform coverage, key tensions, open questions)
- Identified the post-score engagement gap as the critical product question
- Identified calendar integration as a natural reinforcement loop

## What We Did NOT Build

- No code changes shipped
- No content published
- No wearable integration started

### 5. Research as Standing Workstream (New)

Research is the foundation — the scoring engine, the content hooks, and the product credibility all trace back to digging into real data. This can't be a "when we have time" activity. Captured as a standing workstream in `docs/17-research-workstream.md`:

- **Population data gaps to fill:** VO2 Max (FRIEND Registry), HRV norms (UK Biobank), sleep regularity (Windred/UK Biobank), steps (Paluch/NHANES accelerometer)
- **Emerging science to track:** Yamanaka factors in FDA trials, GLP-1 population effects (5%+ of US adults shifting baselines), continuous monitoring (consumer CGMs, continuous BP), AI-driven biomarkers, epigenetic clocks
- **Content hooks from research:** Every counterintuitive finding backed by hard data becomes a standalone post. The Norway comparison, the insulin spike, the Lp(a) story — all came from research sprints.
- **Process:** question → source → extract data → verify → document → integrate or queue → content test

### 6. Calendar Integration Clarification

Daily-ops is Andrew's personal task system (separate repo, separate concern). The calendar integration idea for Baseline is a product feature: timeline actions → Google Calendar events as a reinforcement loop for users. "BP Day 4 of 7" as a reminder. Not about integrating with daily-ops.

## Open for Tomorrow

**Priority question (fresh brain + caffeine):** Given limited time, what's the highest-leverage work for Baseline this week? Four candidates:

1. **Ship content** (X thread + Reddit post — already drafted, highest reach, 10K ft)
2. **Build post-score engagement** (timeline card + calendar integration — the real product, 5K ft)
3. **Implement 3-phase intake** (designed today, improves first-visit UX, 5K ft)
4. **Research sprint** (fill population data gaps, find new hooks, feed content pipeline)

Need to prioritize ruthlessly. What moves the needle most this week?
