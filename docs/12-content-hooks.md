**Date:** February 25, 2026 | **Status:** Running list
**Purpose:** Track every shareable content idea as they emerge. Each hook is free-standing advice that demonstrates domain depth without revealing the scoring architecture.

## From This Session (Feb 25, 2026)

### New hooks surfaced during lab extraction and scoring work

| # | Hook | One-liner | Why it works | Source moment |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Norway comparison** | "Your insulin is average for Americans. In Norway, you'd be in the bottom quartile." | Reframes "average" as "average for a sick population." Visceral, shareable. | International cross-reference discussion |
| 2 | **The insulin spike** | "My insulin went from 3.5 to 13.9 in 8 months. A single-draw dashboard would say 'normal.' A longitudinal system screams 'investigate.'" | Demonstrates why temporal tracking matters — the core product value. Real story. | Andrew's lab extraction |
| 3 | **Connect your Garmin, close 6 gaps** | "One action — syncing your wearable — closes 6 health coverage gaps at once. Sleep, steps, heart rate, VO2 max, HRV, and Zone 2 cardio." | Shows the action bundling insight. Makes coverage scoring tangible. | Gap ranking output |
| 4 | **42% coverage with full blood work** | "I have 7 blood draws over 2 years — 200 biomarkers — and my health picture is still only 42% complete." | Counterintuitive. People think labs = health knowledge. | Scoring engine output |
| 5 | **$50 and 30 minutes to 90%** | "Going from 42% to 90% health coverage costs under $50 and 30 minutes: a $40 cuff, a $3 tape measure, connecting your wearable, and answering a questionnaire." | Makes the coverage gap concrete and solvable. Great CTA. | Gap ranking analysis |
| 6 | **200 biomarkers, 20 scored** | "Your Quest lab PDF has ~200 line items. Most health apps use 5-10. We score 20 and tell you which of the other 180 matter." | Positions against competitors (Function Health, InsideTracker). | Leaky bucket discussion |
| 7 | **Average is not healthy** | "The average American fasting insulin is 8.4. The average Norwegian's is lower. 'Average' on a US health app means 'typical for a population where 96 million people are prediabetic.'" | Combines the US-is-sick insight with the international comparison. Educational, shareable. | Scoring algorithm review |
| 8 | **The leaky bucket** | "We parsed 7 Quest PDFs. On the first pass, we missed Vitamin D — it was on page 8 of a 10-page report. That's the leaky bucket problem: your data exists, but nobody reads all of it." | Real story. Relatable to anyone who's gotten a thick lab report. | Full parsing discussion |
| 9 | **Your doctor never ordered this test** | "Lp(a): $30, once in your life, 20% chance it changes everything. Your doctor probably never ordered it. Neither did your health app." | Combines the Lp(a) hook with a jab at existing tools. | Coverage scoring |
| 10 | **Vitamin D: 29 → 54** | "My Vitamin D went from insufficient (29) to optimal (54) over 18 months. I only know this because I tracked it across 3 draws. A single snapshot would have told me nothing." | Another longitudinal story. Shows supplementation working. | Lab extraction trends |

## Previously Documented Hooks

### From 03-coverage-roi.md — Tier Framework Hooks

| # | Hook | One-liner |
|---|------|-----------|
| 11 | **Waist-to-height ratio** | "Forget BMI. If your waist is less than half your height, you're good. $3 tape measure beats a $300 scale." |
| 12 | **Lp(a) test** | "$30, once in your life, 20% chance it changes everything." |
| 13 | **Blood pressure cuff** | "A $40 cuff has more evidence behind it than every consumer wearable combined." |
| 14 | **Fasting insulin** | "Your glucose looks normal. Your insulin has been screaming for 10 years." |
| 15 | **Sleep regularity** | "8 hours doesn't help if it's 10pm-6am Monday and 1am-9am Saturday." |

### From 05-twitter-thread-draft.md — Thread + Alt Hooks

| # | Hook | Format |
|---|------|--------|
| 16 | **Primary thread hook** | "I spent 3 months reading meta-analyses to answer one question: if you could only track a few health metrics, which ones actually matter?" |
| 17 | **Alt Hook A** | "The health tracking industry wants you to buy a $300 ring and a $200/month CGM. The 10 highest-ROI health metrics cost $143/year. Several are free." |
| 18 | **Alt Hook B** | "A $40 blood pressure cuff has more evidence behind it than every consumer health wearable combined." |
| 19 | **Alt Hook C** | "96 million Americans are prediabetic and don't know it. 47% have hypertension and half are unaware. I ranked 40 health metrics by ROI." |
| 20 | **Medication list as sleeper** | "The most underrated health metric isn't a biomarker — it's your medication list. Without it, every other number gets misread." |

### From 08-former-smoker-mitigation.md — Smoking Hooks

| # | Hook | One-liner |
|---|------|-----------|
| 21 | **Two-track recovery** | "Your heart forgives you for smoking. Your lungs don't. Here's the data." |
| 22 | **Exercise as CVD accelerator** | "Exercise doesn't just prevent heart disease — for former smokers, it can compress 15 years of recovery into 5." |
| 23 | **Beta-carotene danger** | "The supplement that *increases* cancer risk in former smokers." |
| 24 | **Lab interpretation** | "How to read your labs differently if you used to smoke." |
| 25 | **Pack-year education** | "Why your doctor asks if you smoke but not *how much*. Pack-years matter." |

### From 07-spinal-health-height.md — Fitness Hooks

| # | Hook | One-liner |
|---|------|-----------|
| 26 | **Heavy squats** | "Heavy squats don't compress your spine. NOT squatting does." |
| 27 | **Disc hydration** | "You lose 15-19mm of height every day. Here's why it comes back." |
| 28 | **Swimming paradox** | "Swimming is great for your heart. It's bad for your bones." |
| 29 | **Height at 70** | "Your height at 70 depends on what you do at 35." |

### From 06-demographic-stratification.md — Equity/Landscape Hooks

| # | Hook | One-liner | Target audience |
|---|------|-----------|----------------|
| 30 | **Lp(a) stratification** | "If you're Black, your Lp(a) percentile on most health apps is wrong — here's why" | r/blackladies, health equity |
| 31 | **Menopausal lipid shift** | "Your lipid panel 'getting worse' at 50 is expected — here's the data most apps don't adjust for" | r/Menopause, r/perimenopause |
| 32 | **Asian waist thresholds** | "The waist circumference threshold your doctor uses was set for white men. Here's the one calibrated for you." | r/AsianAmerican |
