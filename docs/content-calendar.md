## Posting Rules

1. **7-9 AM ET, Tue-Thu** for X threads and LinkedIn. Health/science content peaks mid-week mornings.
2. **Afternoons for Reddit.** Different audience behavior — more browsing after work.
3. **One platform per day max** for original content. QTs and replies don't count.
4. **No double-posting across subreddits** on the same day. Learned this the hard way.
5. **Reply to every comment** in the first 2 hours. Algorithm rewards early engagement velocity.
6. **No links in Reddit posts** unless they're to the methodology page (value-add, not promo). Product links only in comments if asked.
7. **Screenshot X threads for LinkedIn/Reddit.** Different formats for different platforms.
