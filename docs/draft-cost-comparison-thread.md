# Cost Comparison Thread — X + LinkedIn

**Hook:** "I spend less on health tracking than most people spend on their wearable subscription"
**Voice:** Same as main thread. Engineer, data-forward, no hype.

## X Thread

**1/ (Hook)**

I compared the cost of tracking the 10 most evidence-backed health metrics against every major health product on the market.

Function Health: $365/yr
InsideTracker: $249-589/yr
Oura: $369 yr 1
Whoop: $239/yr

Baseline's top 10: ~$100/yr. Here's the breakdown.

**2/**

First — these products are genuinely good at what they do. This isn't a takedown.

But they each cover a slice. None of them cover the full foundation. And none of them tell you what's missing.

**3/**

Function Health: 160+ lab tests for $365/yr. Incredible depth. Clinician review included.

Foundation coverage: ~62%.

What it misses: blood pressure monitoring, family history, sleep regularity, daily steps, medication context, waist circumference.

No blood test covers those.

**4/**

Oura Ring: $299 + $70/yr. Best-in-class sleep and HRV tracking.

Foundation coverage: ~22%.

It nails sleep, resting HR, and HRV. But it doesn't touch blood work, blood pressure, family history, or body measurements. Different slice entirely.

**5/**

Whoop: $239/yr. Recovery, strain, sleep.

Foundation coverage: ~22%.

Same story as Oura — excellent at what it tracks, but limited to activity and recovery metrics. No labs, no body measurements, no context.

**6/**

InsideTracker: $249-589/yr. Blood + DNA + some wearable integration.

Foundation coverage: ~55%.

Closest to comprehensive, but still missing blood pressure monitoring, waist, and family history. And the pricing adds up fast.

**7/**

Baseline T1: ~$100/yr. All 10 foundation metrics.

$40 blood pressure cuff (one-time, amortized ~$8/yr)
$70-110 annual labs (lipids + ApoB + metabolic + Lp(a))
$3 tape measure (one-time)
Everything else: free (wearable, phone, conversations)

Foundation coverage: 100%.

**8/**

The key insight: 7 of the 10 highest-ROI health metrics don't require a blood draw.

Blood pressure cuff. Tape measure. Your phone counting steps. A conversation with your parents. Checking your medication list.

Most of the foundation is free or near-free.

**9/**

These aren't competing products. They're complementary slices.

A Function Health member who runs Baseline discovers they're still missing blood pressure monitoring, family history, and sleep regularity.

An Oura user discovers they've never had ApoB or fasting insulin tested.

**10/ (Close)**

The coverage score isn't about having the most data. It's about having the right data.

I scored myself across all 40 metrics. Started at 42%. The cheapest path to 80% was ~$50.

## LinkedIn Post (standalone, not a thread)

I compared the annual cost of tracking the 10 most evidence-backed health metrics against every major health product on the market.

Function Health: $365/yr — 160+ lab tests, ~62% foundation coverage
InsideTracker: $249-589/yr — blood + DNA, ~55% foundation coverage
Oura: $369 yr 1 — sleep + HRV, ~22% foundation coverage
Whoop: $239/yr — recovery + strain, ~22% foundation coverage

The 10 metrics with the strongest causal evidence for mortality reduction: ~$100/yr.

7 of the 10 don't require a blood draw.

$40 blood pressure cuff. $3 tape measure. Your phone counting steps. A conversation with your parents about family history.

These products are genuinely good at what they do. But they each cover a slice. None of them cover the full foundation — and none of them tell you what's missing.

That's what I'm building. A scoring layer that works on top of whatever you already use.

| Day | Tweet to QT | Standalone angle |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| +2 | #3 (Function Health) | "Function Health is excellent. But 160+ blood tests still miss 38% of the foundation." |
| +3 | #8 (7 of 10 free) | "7 of the 10 highest-ROI health metrics are free. The most expensive is a $40 cuff." |
| +5 | #9 (Complementary) | "Your Oura ring is great at sleep. It has no idea if your ApoB is elevated." |
| +7 | #7 (Baseline T1) | "Annual cost of tracking all 10 foundation metrics: ~$100. Year 2: ~$70." |

## Posting Schedule

Depends on when the main Baseline thread went out. Options:

**Option A — Same week as main thread:**
Post this as a follow-up thread 3-5 days after the main "40 metrics ranked by ROI" thread. QT tweet #1 of the new thread from the main thread's close tweet to create a link.

**Option B — Standalone:**
Post independently. Works fine without the main thread as context. The cost comparison stands on its own.

**LinkedIn:** Post same day as X thread, morning (7-9 AM ET, Tue-Thu).
