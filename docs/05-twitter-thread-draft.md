## Hook (Primary)

I spent 3 months reading meta-analyses to answer one question: if you could only track a few health metrics, which ones actually matter?

I ranked 40 metrics by ROI — cost, evidence strength, and actionability.

The top 10 cost a combined $143/year. Some cost $0.

## Thread

**Tweet 2:**

The methodology: I scored each metric on three axes.

1. Strength of causal evidence (RCTs > cohort > cross-sectional)
2. Cost to measure
3. Whether knowing the number actually changes outcomes

Most "health tracking" fails on #3.

**Tweet 3:**

#1: Blood pressure. $40 one-time purchase.

Each 20 mmHg increase above 115 systolic doubles your CVD mortality. That's from a 1M-participant study. SPRINT trial showed intensive lowering cut all-cause mortality 27%.

47% of US adults have hypertension. Half don't know it. A $40 cuff fixes that.

**Tweet 4:**

#2: Lipid panel with ApoB. $30-50/year.

Here's what most panels miss: when ApoB and LDL-C disagree on your risk, ApoB wins. It's causally linked to atherosclerosis. Statin therapy reduces CV events ~22% per 1 mmol/L LDL reduction across 170K+ participants.

Ask for ApoB specifically. Most doctors won't order it unless you do.

**Tweet 5:**

#3: Fasting insulin + metabolic panel. $40-60/year.

96 million Americans are prediabetic. Most have no idea. Insulin resistance shows up 10-15 years before a diabetes diagnosis.

Lifestyle intervention reduces progression by 58%. But only if you catch it.

**Tweet 6:**

#4: Family history. Free.

Parental CVD before 60 roughly doubles your risk. This is the poor man's genetic test — one conversation with your parents changes your entire risk model.

You only need to do it once.

**Tweet 7:**

#5: Sleep regularity. Free with any wearable.

This one surprised me. UK Biobank data on 72K people: sleep regularity predicts mortality MORE than sleep duration. Consistent bed/wake times beat "8 hours" with a chaotic schedule.

Separately: each 1% reduction in deep sleep correlates with 27% increased dementia risk.

**Tweet 8:**

#6-7: Daily steps and resting heart rate. Both free.

Steps: each additional 1,000/day = ~15% lower all-cause mortality. 47K-participant meta-analysis. Benefits plateau around 10K.

RHR: 71-80 bpm = 51% higher all-cause mortality vs. 51-60 bpm. Your watch already tracks this. Look at the trend.

**Tweet 9:**

#8: Waist circumference. $3 tape measure.

Independent CVD predictor beyond BMI. The INTERHEART study identified 9 factors explaining 90% of heart attack risk globally. Waist-to-hip ratio was one of them.

BMI can't distinguish muscle from visceral fat. A tape measure can approximate what matters.

**Tweet 10:**

#9: Your medication list. Free.

This one sounds boring. It's not. Without it, everything else gets misread.

Statins change your lipid numbers. Beta-blockers suppress your HR and HRV. Metformin alters your glucose curve. If your tracker doesn't know what you're taking, the data lies to you.

**Tweet 11:**

#10: Lp(a). ~$30. Once in your entire life.

20% of people have elevated Lp(a). It's genetically fixed — doesn't respond to diet or exercise, barely changes over time. Invisible on a standard lipid panel.

One blood draw. One number. It either changes your risk model permanently or it doesn't. $30.

**Tweet 12:**

Now — where tracking is actively counterproductive.

PSA screening: 27 men get overtreated for every 1 death prevented. CGMs for non-diabetics: no evidence of benefit, documented increase in food anxiety. Mood tracking in anxious people: can amplify the thing you're trying to manage.

More data is not always better data.

**Tweet 13 (CTA):**

I ran myself through all 40 metrics. My coverage score: roughly 40-50%.

Three moves totaling $73 would jump me to 80%. The gaps weren't what I expected.

I'm building a tool that calculates your personal coverage score and tells you exactly which tests close your biggest gaps.

## Alternative Hooks (A/B test)

**Alt A:**

The health tracking industry wants you to buy a $300 ring and a $200/month CGM.

I spent 3 months in the literature. The 10 highest-ROI health metrics cost a combined $143/year. Several are free. One costs $30 and you only need it once.

Here's the ranked list:

**Alt B:**

A $40 blood pressure cuff has more evidence behind it than every consumer health wearable combined.

I ranked 40 health metrics by cost, evidence quality, and whether the data actually changes outcomes. The results were humbling. Thread.

**Alt C:**

96 million Americans are prediabetic and don't know it. 47% have hypertension and half are unaware. 20% carry a genetic lipid risk factor that doesn't show up on standard tests.

I ranked 40 health metrics by ROI. The cheapest ones had the strongest evidence. Here's the list:

## Notes

- No emojis. The data carries the weight.
- Each tweet stands alone if screenshotted.
- Tone: engineer who did the research, not health influencer.
- Post full thread simultaneously so algorithm treats it as one unit.
- The medication list tweet (#10) is the sleeper — most counterintuitive inclusion, will draw replies.
- Quote-tweet the Lp(a) or "counterproductive tracking" tweets as standalone posts a few days later.
- Full 40 metrics are NOT in the thread — that's the incentive to click through to the landing page.
