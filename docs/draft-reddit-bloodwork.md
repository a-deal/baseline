## Post

**Title:** My insulin went from 3.5 to 13.9 in 8 months. A single draw would've said "normal."

**Body:**

35M here, 7 Quest draws over the past 2 years (Function Health + one standard panel). Been tracking everything in a structured format because I got tired of logging into MyQuest and comparing PDFs side by side.

The thing that caught my attention: my fasting insulin.

- Feb 2024: 5.0 uIU/mL
- Sep 2024: 5.3
- Jun 2025: 3.5
- Feb 2026: 13.9

Every single one of those values falls within the standard reference range (2.6–24.9). If you looked at any one draw in isolation, you'd see "normal" and move on. But a 4x spike after 18 months of stability? That's a signal.

My doctor didn't flag it. The Quest report didn't flag it. The only reason I noticed was because I had the trend line in front of me.

I don't know what caused it yet — could've been a non-fasting draw, lab variability, or something real. I'm getting a repeat. But that's the point: without the history, I'd have looked at 13.9, seen it's within range, and moved on. With the history, I'm investigating.

This got me down a rabbit hole of actually trying to understand my labs longitudinally — not just "is this value in range" but "how does this compare to my last draw, and where do I sit relative to the population?"

Some other things I noticed once I started tracking across draws:

- **Vitamin D:** Went from 29 (flagged low) to 54 over 15 months of supplementation. Would never have known it was working without the trend.
- **Iron saturation:** Dropped from 44% to 32% to 19% (flagged low) across three draws. Each value in isolation looks fine-ish. The trajectory says something's going on.
- **LDL-C vs. ApoB:** LDL at 87 looks great on paper. But without ApoB (mine's 72), I'd be missing the more causally relevant number. Most standard panels don't include it.
- **Ferritin:** 150 ng/mL — my doctor said "fine." Turns out that's roughly the 43rd percentile for men my age. Not bad, not great. Context matters.

The biggest realization: I have ~200 line items across my draws, and I can meaningfully interpret maybe 15-20 of them. The rest just sit there in PDFs I'll never look at again.

I'm working on a system to track everything longitudinally with real population percentiles (not just Quest's reference ranges, which are designed to catch disease, not assess health). Still early, but it's already changed how I think about my labs.

**Curious — how do others here keep track of their results across multiple draws and providers?** Spreadsheets? Apps? Just eyeballing the PDF each time?

## Notes

- Voice: genuine, first-person, "just a guy." Not promoting anything.
- The closing question is the data collection — we want to hear about workflows.
- The "200 line items, 15-20 meaningful" line sets up the coverage concept without naming it.
- ApoB mention plants a seed for the "your doctor didn't order this" hook.
- Iron saturation trajectory is a NEW addition — stronger than the old Ferritin "43rd percentile" example because it shows a clear downward trend across 3 draws. Keeps Ferritin but moves it down.
- No links, no CTA, no product mention. Pure content. If people ask "what system?" in comments, that's the opening.
- The insulin narrative is now REAL and UNRESOLVED — "I don't know what caused it yet, I'm getting a repeat." This is more authentic and more engaging than the old version which fabricated a resolved arc (the fake "back down to 4.2").
- All dates verified against draws/andrew.json longitudinal store.
- Flair: "Discussion" or "Results" depending on sub rules.
