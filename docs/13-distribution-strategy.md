# Baseline — Distribution Strategy

**Date:** February 26, 2026 | **Status:** Active
**Decision:** Shift primary focus to distribution and feedback collection (Feb 26, resolved)

## Voice & Positioning

**Core voice:** "Just a guy trying to understand his health." Not a health influencer. Not selling anything. Engineer who did the research and is sharing what he found.

**Key principles:**
- Data carries the weight — no emojis, no hype
- Each post should work as standalone insight
- Subtle data collection: open-ended closing questions, not surveys
- Build credibility before asking for anything
- Real story (Andrew's 7 Quest draws, 200 biomarkers) is the differentiator

## Channel Strategy

### Wave 1: Targeted Communities (Week 1-2)

| Channel | Audience | Hook | Goal |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **r/bloodwork** (30K) | People who already track labs | Insulin spike story (#2) | Qualitative feedback on tracking pain points |
| **r/QuantifiedSelf** (180K) | Self-trackers, data nerds | 40 metrics ranked by ROI (#33) | Technical credibility, early adopters |
| **r/longevity** (200K+) | Longevity-focused | "Average is not healthy" + Norway comparison | Philosophical alignment |

### Wave 2: Broader Reach (Week 2-3)

| Channel | Audience | Hook | Goal |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **X/Twitter** | Health-curious general audience | Full thread (05-twitter-thread-draft.md) | Reach, virality, quote-tweet flywheel |
| **r/Biohackers** (300K+) | Optimization-minded | Coverage score concept (#4, #5) | Product concept validation |

### Wave 3: Technical + Niche (Week 3-4)

| Channel | Audience | Hook | Goal |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **Hacker News** (Show HN) | Developers, builders | MCP server angle, local-first architecture | Technical users, contributors |
| **Obsidian Discord/Forum** | PKM/local-first enthusiasts | "Health data as structured knowledge" | Natural early adopter segment |
| **r/blackladies, r/Menopause, r/AsianAmerican** | Demographic-specific | Equity hooks (#30-32) | Underserved audiences, sensitivity testing |

## X/Twitter Strategy (Small Account Playbook)

**Reality:** Small follower count means organic reach is near zero. Strategy is earned distribution, not broadcast.

### Tactics:
1. **Reply-first:** Engage in threads by Peter Attia, Andrew Huberman, Rhonda Patrick, Bryan Johnson. Add data points, not opinions. Build visibility before posting own thread.
2. **Tag mid-tier accounts** (1K-50K followers) who discuss these topics — they're more likely to engage than mega-accounts.
3. **Timing:** Post 7-9 AM ET weekdays. Health/science content peaks Tuesday-Thursday.
4. **Seed engagement:** Share thread link in relevant Discord servers, Slack groups, and Reddit posts (where appropriate).
5. **Cross-post:** Screenshot key tweets for Reddit/LinkedIn. Different formats for different platforms.
6. **Quote-tweet flywheel:** After initial thread, quote-tweet individual tweets (Lp(a), insulin, medication list) as standalone posts over the following week.
7. **Thread as one unit:** Post all tweets simultaneously so the algorithm treats it as a single piece of content.

### Content cadence:
- **Week 1:** Reply to 5-10 relevant threads. No original content yet. Build presence.
- **Week 2:** Post the main thread. Cross-post to Reddit simultaneously.
- **Week 3+:** Quote-tweet individual insights. Respond to every reply. Start conversations.

## Data Collection Strategy

**Goal:** Understand how people currently store and track health data — without running a formal survey.

### Subtle collection methods:
1. **Closing questions on posts:** "Curious — how do others here keep track of labs across multiple draws/providers?" Invites sharing without feeling like a survey.
2. **"Show me yours" framing:** Post Andrew's tracking approach, ask others to share theirs. People love showing their systems.
3. **Poll tweets:** "Where do your lab results live right now?" with options (paper folder / MyChart / spreadsheet / app / no idea). Low friction, high signal.
4. **DM conversations:** When someone engages meaningfully, follow up in DMs. "Would love to hear more about your setup."
5. **r/QuantifiedSelf monthly thread:** Community already shares tools and workflows. Participate and observe.

### What we're trying to learn:
- How do people currently store lab results? (PDF folder? MyChart? Spreadsheet? Nothing?)
- Do they track trends across draws, or just look at the most recent?
- What triggers them to get labs done? (Doctor order? Proactive? Symptoms?)
- Do they compare against population data or just reference ranges?
- What's missing from existing tools they've tried?

## Success Metrics

**Week 1-2:**
- 5+ substantive replies on Reddit posts (not just upvotes)
- 3+ people sharing their own tracking workflows
- Qualitative signal on biggest pain points

**Week 3-4:**
- 50+ engagements on X thread
- 10+ DM conversations with potential early users
- Clear pattern in how people track (or don't track) labs

**Month 2:**
- Email list of 50+ interested people
- Enough qualitative data to prioritize first distribution format (CLI? Web? Obsidian plugin?)
- One content piece that clearly outperforms others → double down on that angle

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Feb 26 | Shift from data refinement to distribution | Remaining NHANES/FRIEND/KNHANES work is marginal gains. 19/20 metrics already backed by real population data. Feedback from real people is higher signal. |
| Feb 26 | Reddit before X | Targeted communities (r/bloodwork, r/QuantifiedSelf) give qualitative depth. X gives breadth but requires follower base to work. Build credibility in communities first. |
| Feb 26 | Subtle data collection over formal surveys | Surveys feel extractive. Open-ended closing questions on genuine content posts feel natural. |
