# Cut Tracker — Agent Handoff

## What This Is
A multi-page dashboard that tracks Andrew's active cut (caloric deficit) in real time. Split into two pages:
- **Monitoring dashboard** (`cut_tracker.html`) — weight trend, KPIs, recovery markers (Garmin), strength tracking, protocol reference, daily check-in
- **Nutrition page** (`nutrition.html`) — today's macros remaining-to-hit, meal log, daily meal template, daily totals

Both share `shared.css` (styles) and `shared.js` (constants + utilities). Served by a persistent `launchd` agent (`com.baseline.dashboard`) running `python3 -m http.server 8787` from the baseline project root. Always available at:
- `http://localhost:8787/dashboard/cut_tracker.html`
- `http://localhost:8787/dashboard/nutrition.html`

No build step — edit any file, refresh browser, see changes immediately.

## Owner
Andrew Deal, 35M. Former personal trainer + gym owner. 20 years lifting experience. Android + Garmin (no iOS/Apple Health).

## Cut Protocol
- **Dates**: Jan 23 – ~Apr 7, 2026 (11 weeks)
- **Start**: 203.0 lbs → **Target**: 188.0 lbs (15 lbs total)
- **Current** (Feb 27): ~194.7 lbs, 7-day avg ~195.4
- **Rate**: ~1.3 lbs/week (adjusted down from 1.9 for fatigue/muscle retention)
- **Safe zone**: 0.5-1% BW/week (1.0-2.0 lbs/week)
- **Daily calorie target**: ~2,100 cal
- **Macro targets**: 190g+ protein / ~180g carbs / ~60g fat

## Daily Check-in Protocol
Andrew logs 4 things daily (~30 seconds):
1. **Weight** — morning, post-bathroom
2. **Protein** — rough estimate ("2 RX bars + shake + Chipotle bowl")
3. **Lift** — exercise/weight/reps if trained (rest days: type of activity)
4. **Sleep** — subjective quality

**Flags to raise:**
- Protein <160g for 3+ consecutive days
- Weight loss rate >1% BW/week for 2+ consecutive weeks
- RHR trending >55 bpm (currently ~49)
- HRV dropping <50 ms sustained (currently ~65)

## Common Foods (macros Andrew uses regularly)
| Food | P | C | F | Cal |
|------|---|---|---|-----|
| Pro Advanced Shake | 30g | 5g | 2g | 154 |
| RX Bar | 12g | 23g | 9g | 210 |
| Chipotle bowl (steak + extra chicken, rice, beans, fajitas, pico — NO cheese/sour cream) | ~65g | ~67g | ~18g | ~715 |
| Chipotle tortilla chips | ~8g | ~73g | ~27g | ~570 |
| Chipotle guac (side) | ~2g | ~8g | ~15g | ~170 |
| 2 medium bananas (pre-workout) | ~2g | ~55g | ~1g | ~210 |

## Medications (cut-specific, affects tracking)
- **Tirzepatide**: 2.5-3.5mg/week (appetite suppressant — may run deeper effective deficit than intended)
- **THC**: 10-20mg nightly (sleep onset + appetite management; suppresses REM, may blunt HRV)
- **Finasteride**: 1.2mg daily (ongoing, not cut-specific)
- **Creatine**: should be taking 5g/day (may not be consistent)

## Tracker UX Preferences
- **Show remaining-to-hit**, not cumulative eaten. Andrew wants to see "71g protein remaining" not "119g protein eaten." The remaining view tells him exactly what to eat for the rest of the day.
- Meal log shows eaten meals at full opacity, planned/upcoming meals dimmed (opacity 0.4)
- Training status in header: "Training Day" or "Rest Day (activity type)"

## Page Architecture

### Monitoring dashboard (`cut_tracker.html`)
- Header with nav link to nutrition page (`Nutrition →`)
- KPI strip (current weight, 7-day avg, total lost, to target, weekly rate, ETA)
- Compact nutrition summary strip (one-liner: `119/190g P · 118/180g C · ...`) — links to nutrition page
- Weight chart (SVG, daily dots + 7-day rolling avg + projection to target)
- Rate of loss (weekly bars, color-coded by safe zone)
- Recovery markers (RHR, HRV, sleep duration, sleep regularity) — from `garmin_latest.json`
- Cut timeline (progress bar with NOW marker)
- Strength section (DOTS score, lift bars vs all-time, recent lifts table)
- Protocol reference (medications, nutrition strategy, watch signals)
- Daily check-in format
- Fetches: `weight_log.csv`, `meal_log.csv` (summary only), `garmin_latest.json`, `strength_log.csv`

### Nutrition page (`nutrition.html`)
- Header with nav link back to dashboard (`← Dashboard`)
- Protein hero (remaining-to-hit, progress bar)
- Macro grid (carbs/fat/calories remaining)
- Meal log table (today's meals from `meal_log.csv`)
- Daily template (4-column Meal 1–4 cards)
- Daily totals (training day vs rest day)
- Fetches: `meal_log.csv` only

### Shared utilities (`shared.js`)
All exported as `window.*` globals (no build step):
- `CUT` — cut parameters (dates, weights, peaks, macro targets)
- `LIFT_COLORS` — color map for lift types
- `parseCSV(text)` — CSV string → array of objects
- `dayIndex(dateStr)` — days since cut start
- `dayToX(d)` / `weightToY(w)` — SVG coordinate helpers
- `todayStr()` — today as YYYY-MM-DD
- `fmtDate(dateStr)` — "Feb 27" format
- `est1RM(weight, reps, rpe)` — RPE-based 1RM estimation
- `safeFetch(url, json)` — fetch with error handling

## Dev Server
Always running via `launchd` agent `com.baseline.dashboard`:
- Plist: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.baseline.dashboard.plist`
- Port: 8787 (shared with Baseline web app at `/app/`)
- Logs: `~/.local/log/baseline-dashboard.log`
- Auto-starts on login, auto-restarts on crash
- No hot reload needed — serves from disk on every request, just refresh browser
- Control: `launchctl unload/load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.baseline.dashboard.plist`

## How to Update
Both pages fetch CSV/JSON data dynamically on page load. To update:
1. Edit the relevant CSV file (`weight_log.csv`, `meal_log.csv`, `strength_log.csv`) or run `garmin_import.py`
2. Refresh the browser — new data appears immediately

The weight chart SVG coordinates use: Y-axis 204 lbs at top (y=20) to 188 lbs at bottom (y=240), scale = 13.75px per lb. X-axis spans Jan 25 to Apr 7.

## Recovery Markers (Garmin, as of Feb 26)
- RHR: 49.3 bpm (excellent)
- HRV: 64.7 ms RMSSD (good)
- Sleep duration: 6.6 hrs avg (below 7hr target)
- Sleep regularity: ±110 min stdev (concerning, ~10th percentile)
- VO2 max: 47.0 mL/kg/min (strong)
- Zone 2 cardio: 184 min/week (excellent)
- Nocturia since age 19-20 (disrupts sleep continuity)

## Training Context
- All-time 1RMs: Deadlift ~550, Squat 425, Bench 315 (total ~1,290)
- Current est 1RMs: Deadlift ~500 (91%), Bench ~278 (88%), Squat TBD
- Recently favoring dumbbells + belt squat (avoiding spinal loading for ~1.5 years)
- DOTS score: ~267 current, ~299 all-time peak

## Refeed Strategy
- Mini refeed at week 5: 2 days at maintenance (~2,800-3,000 cal), high carb, same protein
- Train on refeed days — diagnostic: if strength bounces back, fatigue is caloric; if not, it's sleep debt
- Expect 2-3 lb water/glycogen bounce post-refeed, resolves in 3 days

## Nutrition Insights
- Pre-workout: bananas need 30-45 min lead time, not 2 min
- Tirzepatide suppresses appetite → evening meals should be larger (caloric deficit front-loaded)
- Bigger last meal improves sleep quality (tryptophan) — Andrew confirmed this
- Sleep quality improves noticeably with adequate calories

## What's NOT in Scope for the Cut Tracker
- The Baseline scoring engine / web app (separate workstream in `app/`)
- Post-cut planning (reverse diet, lean bulk) — see memory files
- Peptide/TRT decisions — deferred to mid-2026
