96M Americans are prediabetic. 47% have hypertension — half don't know it. 20% carry a genetic lipid risk factor invisible on standard tests.

I spent 3 months in the literature ranking 40 health metrics by ROI.

The top 10 cost $143/year combined. Several are free.
---
Methodology: I scored each metric on 3 axes.

1. Strength of causal evidence (RCTs > cohort > cross-sectional)
2. Cost to measure
3. Whether knowing the number actually changes what you do

Most "health tracking" fails on #3.

#1: Blood pressure. $40 one-time.

Each 20 mmHg above 115 systolic doubles CVD mortality (1M-participant meta-analysis). SPRINT showed intensive lowering cut all-cause mortality 27%.

47% of US adults have hypertension. Half are unaware. A $40 cuff fixes that.
---
#2: Lipid panel + ApoB. $30-50/year.

When ApoB and LDL-C disagree on your risk, ApoB wins. It's causally linked to atherosclerosis. Most panels don't include it.

Ask for it by name. Your doctor probably won't order it otherwise.
---
#3: Fasting insulin + metabolic panel. $40-60/year.

Insulin resistance shows up 10-15 years before a diabetes diagnosis. Lifestyle intervention reduces progression by 58%.

But only if you catch it. Standard glucose tests miss early-stage insulin resistance.
---
#4: Family history. Free.

Parental CVD before 60 roughly doubles your risk. One conversation with your parents changes your entire risk model. You only need to do it once.

The cheapest, highest-ROI health data you'll ever collect.
---
#5: Sleep regularity. Free (any wearable).

UK Biobank, 72K people: sleep regularity predicts mortality more than sleep duration.

8 hours doesn't help if it's 10pm-6am Monday and 1am-9am Saturday.
---
#6-7: Daily steps + resting heart rate. Both free.

Steps: each additional 1,000/day = ~15% lower all-cause mortality (47K meta-analysis). Benefits plateau around 10K.

RHR: 71-80 bpm = 51% higher mortality vs. 51-60 bpm. Your watch already tracks this.
---
#8: Waist circumference. $3 tape measure.

Forget BMI. The INTERHEART study identified 9 factors explaining 90% of heart attack risk. Waist-to-hip ratio was one.

If your waist is less than half your height, you're in good shape. BMI can't tell you that.
---
#9: Your medication list.

Sounds boring. It's not.

Statins change your lipids. Beta-blockers suppress HR and HRV. Metformin alters your glucose curve.

If your tracker doesn't know what you're taking, every other number gets misread. This is the most underrated health metric.
---
#10: Lp(a). ~$30. Once in your entire life.

20% of people have elevated Lp(a). Genetically fixed — doesn't respond to diet or exercise. Invisible on a standard panel.

One draw. One number. Either changes your risk model permanently or it doesn't.
---
Now — where tracking is counterproductive.

PSA: 27 men overtreated for every 1 death prevented. CGMs for non-diabetics: no evidence of benefit, documented increase in food anxiety.

More data is not always better data.
---
I scored myself across all 40. Coverage: 42%. Three moves for ~$50 would get me to 80%.
